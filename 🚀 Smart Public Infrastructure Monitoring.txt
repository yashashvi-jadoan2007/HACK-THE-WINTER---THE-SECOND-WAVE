🚀 Smart Public Infrastructure Monitoring & Accountability Platform

"From Complaint-Driven Governance to Self-Aware Cities"

🧩 Problem Overview

Indian cities rely heavily on **citizen complaint platforms** to manage civic issues like:

* Non-functional streetlights
* Overflowing garbage bins
* Unhygienic public toilets
* Broken public infrastructure

Despite multiple apps and portals, the same problems repeat.

❌ Why?

Because existing systems are:

* Reactive (action starts only after complaints)
* Manual & delayed
* Subjective (photo-based, not data-driven)
* Weak on verification
* Weak on accountability

The real issue is not lack of complaints — it is lack of operational intelligence and enforceable accountability.

🎯 Our Solution

We are building a "Unified Civic Intelligence & Accountability Platform" that enables cities to:

* Detect problems automatically
* Verify citizen complaints with data
* Prioritize issues using AI
* Enforce time-bound action
* Verify resolution objectively

> 👉 Complaint + Data + Rules = "Forced Action"

🧠 What Makes Our Solution Different?

This is 'NOT':

* Just another complaint app
* Just an IoT project
* Just a dashboard

This 'IS':

> An "intelligence + enforcement layer" that upgrades existing government systems.

#Key Differentiators

* Citizens are optional — system is never blind
* Complaints are 'verified', not blindly accepted
* Problems are 'predicted', not just reported
* Accountability is 'automated', not request-based

🏗️ System Architecture (High Level)

1️⃣ Automated Ground Monitoring (Hardware Layer)

Low-cost sensors installed on public assets:

* Streetlights → current / light sensors
* Garbage bins → fill-level sensors
* Public toilets → gas, humidity, usage sensors

➡️ Real-time ground truth without waiting for complaints.


2️⃣ Citizen Complaint Intelligence (Human Layer)

Citizens can submit:

* Photo + location
* Issue category

But complaints are treated as 'signals', not final truth.

System:

* Verifies using sensor data
* Merges duplicate complaints
* Assigns risk-based priority

➡️ No spam, no false urgency.

3️⃣ AI Decision & Enforcement Engine (Brain Layer)

AI engine:

* Combines sensor + complaint data
* Calculates 'risk & urgency score'
* Predicts upcoming failures
* Assigns 'official SLA automatically'

➡️ Governance shifts from reactive to preventive.

⏱️ Accountability Mechanism (Core Innovation)

🔐 SLA-Based Time-Bound Action

Each issue maps to official SOPs.

Example:

* Hospital toilet hygiene → 4 hours
* Highway streetlight failure → 12 hours

Timer starts automatically.

🔁 Auto-Escalation (No Manual Ignoring)

If SLA is missed:

[Ward Officer → Zonal Officer → City Commissioner]

Escalation is 'system-driven', not optional.

✅ Evidence-Based Closure

When issue is marked “resolved”:

* Sensors verify before vs after data
* If problem still exists → ticket auto-reopens

➡️ No fake closures.

🔗 Integration With Existing Govt Platforms

We 'do not replace' apps like Swachhata / 311.

We 'upgrade them'.

* Existing apps → complaint input layer
* Our system → intelligence + verification + enforcement

📈 Impact

* Faster issue resolution
* Reduced repeated failures
* Objective accountability
* Better use of public resources
* Increased citizen trust

🧪 Hackathon Scope

For this hackathon:

* One infrastructure module demonstrated (e.g., garbage bins / streetlights)
* AI logic shown via simulation
* Full system represented through architecture & flow

> Judges evaluate **thinking, feasibility, and scalability**, not full deployment.

 
🏆“We are transforming complaint-based civic governance into a self-aware, intelligence-driven, and accountable system.”
